# Functional-Programming-Course

## Introduction
This exercise will give you some experience in developing and testing a complete, small-scale application in the
Haskell language, while making use of standard build tools and third party Haskell libraries.
This task contains 3 main steps:
1. You will begin by producing a library that scrapes a wikipedia web page and identifies most frequent word on that page.
2. You will go on to identify the most frequent words on the pages for several countries, and displaying this information in
a programmatically generated visual form.
3. Finally you will write a short report to summarize your experience with functional programming during this development exercise.
